# Bio 311C Interview Project

This website was created for a project in Biology 311C at The University of Texas at Austin. This website uses the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. Our website includes an interview video, a transcript of the video, some info about our team, some background info about the interviewee, and some extra resources. Enjoy!
