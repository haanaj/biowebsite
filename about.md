**Want to learn more about Markus Hogue? Read the info we have provided below!**

Markus Hogue is the current program coordinator for irrigation and water conservation at the University of Texas at Austin. Hogue graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in information systems and has been managing UT Austin’s irrigation system since 2012. As the program coordinator, Hogue has made many improvements to the university’s irrigation system. One innovation he has worked to integrate on campus is the use of drones to more efficiently assess the health of campus turf and plants. The drones are equipped with cameras that analyze the chlorophyll to determine how stressed the plants are, and which areas need more or less water. This drone technology can also be applied to campus infrastructure by searching for leaks in roofs and photographing construction projects. Looking forward, Hogue hopes to eventually utilize satellite technology to automate lawn mowers, and to further improve UT’s irrigation system through the use of technology and drones.
